# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project uses semantic versioning to continuously release updated versions. This model should allow users to quickly and seamlessly upgrade once new versions become available.

At the moment, only the latest version will be supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you should discover a security vulnerability with a CVSS score higher than 6.9 ('High' or 'Critical'), I would like to ask you to report this privately and responsibly to frank@steilerdev.de. You should receive feedback on those inquiries within 10 business days.

Any other lower security score should be following the [bug reporting process laid out in the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/steilerDev/icloud-photos-sync/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#issue).
